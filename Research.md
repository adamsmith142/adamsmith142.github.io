## Understanding the Earth with Topographic Inversions

The Earth's surface controls the interaction between the solid Earth and the bio- hydro- atmo- and cryo-spheres. Earth's topography is the largest data set available to us that can help develop our undertsanding of these interactions. Topography records the culmination of processes that have acted on it, and my research hinges on our ability to deconvolve these processes from the shape of the Earth itself.

### Rock Uplift Rates in the Wasatch

The Wasatch Range, Utah, is located on the eastern boundary of the Basin and Range, created by slip on the Wasatch Fault. As a seismically active fault located besides Utah's most populated metropolitan areas, and an important structural boundary of the Basin and Range, undertsanding slip on the Wasatch Fault is interesting from a range of perspectives. Although fault slip has been characterised on the 10s of Millions of year timescales, and the < 1000 year timescales, there is little evidence available that characterises fault behaviour between these timescales. 

River network inversions can bridge the gap between these timescales, providing rock uplift rate histories on the million year timescale. We therefore attempted to constrain the million year history of the Wasatch Range by using a river network inversion to infer rock uplift rates through time. We combined this approach with field data, and a number of data sets such as AHe data and erosion rate data derived from cosmogenic nuclides to tightly constrain our model parameters.
