## Understanding the Earth with Topographic Inversions

The Earth's surface controls the interaction between the solid Earth and the bio- hydro- atmo- and cryo-spheres. Earth's topography is the largest data set available to us that can help develop our undertsanding of these interactions. Topography records the culmination of processes that have acted on it, and my research hinges on our ability to deconvolve these processes from the shape of the Earth itself.
